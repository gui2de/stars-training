Olga's song


Grandma used to pray out loud
By her bed every night
To me it sounded like mumblin'
Like she was out of her mind
She said, "Boy this kind of praying
Is what saved my life
You oughta try it some time"
And now I know she was right
She was talking to Jesus
She was talking to Jesus
And she'd been talking to Jesus for all of her life
Mama used to drag me to church
Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights
Khaki pants and a polo shirt
Boy, I put up a fight
She said, "Son, one day you'll thank me
For having God in your life"
And yeah, I know she was right
Yeah, my mama was right
'Cause now I'm talking to Jesus
She got me talking to Jesus
She got me talking to Jesus
Yeah, my mama was right
'Cause now I'm talking to Jesus
Yeah, I love talking to Jesus
And I'll be talking to Jesus
For the rest of my life
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus (don't you know?)
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
(What a friend we have)
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
I've got three of my own now
Tryna raise them up right
My oldest is 15
And I remember what that was like
Tryna deal with the drama
Tryna figure out the questions in life
And I've been looking for a way to show him
How to make it alright
Then he walked in my room
While I was saying my prayers the other night
He said, "I'll come back later
I can tell you got a lot on your mind"
I said, "It's not an interruption
You couldn't have picked a better time
'Cause I was just talking to Jesus
Come over and give it a try"
We started talking to Jesus
We started talking to Jesus
We started talking to Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
And now he's talking to Jesus
Thank God he's talking to Jesus
I hope he's talking to Jesus
For the rest of his life, yeah
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
(What a friend we have)
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
There's no wrong way to do it
There's no bad time to start
It don't have to sound pretty
Just tell Him what's on your heart
'Cause it's not a religion, no
'Cause it's more like a friendship
So just talk to your Father
Like you are His kid
Just start talking to Jesus
Just start talking to Jesus
'Cause you can talk to Jesus
Oh, whenever you like
Just start talking to Jesus
Just start talking to Jesus
Just keep talking to Jesus
For the rest of your life
Oh, just talk
Oh
Just talk, just talk, just talk to Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
(What a friend we have)
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh
Just let it out, let it out, let it out right now (oh-oh)
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out right now (oh-oh)
Let it out, let it out, let it out (oh-oh-oh, oh)
